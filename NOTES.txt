Here are simplified descriptions for AWS EC2 instance types, with examples:

- **General Purpose (T, M series)**: Balanced for everyday tasks like running websites or apps (e.g., web servers, small databases).
- **Compute Optimized (C series)**: Great for tasks that need a lot of processing power, like running machine learning models (e.g., video processing).
- **Memory Optimized (R, X, Z series)**: Perfect for apps that need a lot of memory, like big databases (e.g., data analytics, in-memory caching).
- **Storage Optimized (I, D, H series)**: Ideal for workloads that need fast storage access, like large file systems (e.g., NoSQL databases).
- **Accelerated Computing (P, G, Inf, F series)**: Uses GPUs or other accelerators for high-performance tasks (e.g., machine learning, graphics rendering).
- **High Memory (u-series)**: Designed for very large databases that run in memory (e.g., SAP HANA).

This should keep it clear and easy for your resume!


Here are the types of Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store) volumes with brief descriptions:

- **General Purpose SSD (gp3, gp2)**: Balanced performance and cost, suitable for most workloads like boot volumes and small databases.
- **Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2, io1)**: High-performance SSD for I/O-intensive applications like large databases or critical workloads.
- **Throughput Optimized HDD (st1)**: Low-cost storage for workloads that need high throughput, like big data and data warehouses.
- **Cold HDD (sc1)**: Lowest-cost storage for infrequently accessed data, like backups or archives.
- **Magnetic (standard)**: Legacy magnetic storage for small workloads, usually not recommended for new applications.
